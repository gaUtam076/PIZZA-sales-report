# Pizza Sales Data Analysis - SQL Queries

This project explores the analysis of pizza sales data using SQL queries. The dataset is derived from CSV files containing order information, which is then queried to uncover insights into pizza sales trends and patterns. The analysis spans basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries to extract valuable information related to pizza orders, revenue generation, and customer preferences.

## **Project Overview**

The project focuses on answering a series of analytical questions to help businesses understand their sales performance and make data-driven decisions. The queries span across different levels:

### **Basic Analysis:**

* Total number of orders placed.
* Total revenue generated from pizza sales.
* Highest-priced pizza.
* Most common pizza size ordered.
* Top 5 most ordered pizza types and their quantities.

### **Intermediate Analysis:**

* Total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
* Distribution of orders by hour of the day.
* Category-wise distribution of pizzas.
* Average number of pizzas ordered per day.
* Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### **Advanced Analysis:**

* Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
* Cumulative revenue generated over time.
* Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

## **Technologies Used:**

* SQL (Structured Query Language)
* CSV data format
* Data Analysis & Reporting

## **How to Run:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the dataset into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
3. Execute the queries found in the `queries.sql` file to generate the required reports.
4. Review the findings and insights within the project.

## **Goal of the Project:**

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting and analyzing meaningful business insights from a dataset. It provides a solid example of how SQL queries can help optimize sales strategies, track customer preferences, and improve operational decisions in a real-world business context.

## **File Structure:**

* `queries.sql`: SQL queries for the analysis.
* `pizza_sales_data.csv`: Raw sales data in CSV format.
* `report.pdf`: A detailed report of the analysis and findings.
